- ⚡ Fun fact: After thinking that a corporate job would drain me of my creative fuel, I set out to explore different work opportunities. 
From organizing offbeat treks for a travel enthusiast to the remote hills, founding my own Agri tech start-up to working with some of the finest NGOs. Over the course of time, I have acquired a unique ability to keep a cool head at complex challenges. 

I am a self-taught programmer striving to take up and solve the new challenges of life, in this journey of learning I thank the open source and open courseware community/ free learning of Harvard , MIT, and Stanford. especial thanks to the platforms such as Edx, Coursera, and Youtube.
